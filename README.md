# Digital Intelligence - PwC Switzerland
I took this course at theforage.com that focused on the purpose and goals of the Digital Accelerator program.
Keywords: Python, Rscript, MS 365 (Excel, PowerPoint and Word)

This course had five tasks:
1. Create a classification model in Python with SkLearn library:
  - Analyse the model and provide insight into which features/variables influence the outcome of the classification the most: on a global level, and specifically for observation #4 and #20.
  - Develop some form of plot or graph with brief comments on your observations.
With the result was made a confusion matrix, where was possible to conclude that the *Decision Tree model* produced results that rectified all false positives, ensuring that individuals entitled to credit received it. However, it failed to identify certain cases of potential future default (false negatives), granting credit to individuals who should not have been eligible. Specifically, the model incorrectly flagged 3 individuals as creditworthy. Despite these isolated issues, a comprehensive evaluation of the model indicates its overall high performance. The model demonstrated an impressive accuracy rate of *99.99%*. It is important to note that the desired effectiveness of the model may vary based on the company's requirements. For instance, if the model is mandated to achieve an effectiveness level exceeding 90%, *all analyzed models met this criterion*.

2. Prepare a PowerPoint document containing the results of a portfolio valuation. Also was provided my code in a slide deck to explain how I arrived at my solution.
For this task I choose Excel to present the present value of the forecasted portfolio

4. Prepare a PowerPoitn expaing the Data Analytics & Strategies adopted from PwC Switzerland.
For this task I explained simple concepts about how to extract value from a data that we have. I passed thourgh concepts such as Data Value, Ensuring Data Security and Developing New Analytics and Data Products

5. Created a PowerPoint to show effects of medicines available FEARS datasets:
   - Adverse effects of tramal
   - the 10 most common adverse effects as they are reported
   - Compare tramal to another medication 
For this task I choose use Rscript because the dataset available it was too huge to work on Excel, and thinking of programming language diversity of this course, using another programming language would bring more value and learning from this course.

6. Created a Word document providing the R script to explain assuption related with the Actuarial Services team
